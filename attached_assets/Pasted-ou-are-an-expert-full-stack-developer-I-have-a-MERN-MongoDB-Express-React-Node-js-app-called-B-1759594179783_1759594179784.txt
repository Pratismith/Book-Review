ou are an expert full-stack developer. I have a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) app called Book Review. Here are the problems I need fixed and optimized across backend + frontend: 🚩 Current Problems Books I added only show in the Home page but not in “My Books” section of my Profile page. ✅ Need to ensure books created by the logged-in user (addedBy = req.user._id) are fetched in /api/books/my-books. My Reviews are not showing in the Profile page (“My Reviews” section). ✅ Need to add /api/reviews/my-reviews endpoint that fetches reviews authored by the logged-in user. Book cover photo upload works during adding book, but image is not displayed later when viewing book details. ✅ Need to ensure image URL in Book model and frontend points to /uploads/books/<filename> and backend serves static folder correctly (app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'))). Profile image only appears once — disappears after logout. ✅ Need to fix persistent user state in AuthContext.jsx, store updated user info in localStorage, and reload it when the app starts. Ensure frontend Axios config and backend API routes are consistent (e.g., /api/books, /api/auth, /api/reviews). Make all image URLs fully resolvable in both dev (http://localhost:3001/uploads/...) and production (relative /uploads/...). 🧩 Deliverables Please provide updated working code for the following files (show complete, not partial, versions): 🖥️ Backend controllers/bookController.js controllers/reviewController.js middlewares/upload.js middlewares/uploadUserPhoto.js server.js (to serve static uploads) any new routes like GET /api/books/my-books and GET /api/reviews/my-reviews 🌐 Frontend src/context/AuthContext.jsx → persist user and reload from localStorage src/pages/Profile.jsx → show "My Books" and "My Reviews" dynamically src/pages/AddEditBook.jsx → upload book cover properly src/pages/BookDetails.jsx → correctly display uploaded cover src/api/axios.js → correct baseURL for dev/prod and image access 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix ✅ Adding a book → immediately visible in Home and My Books in profile ✅ Uploading book cover → displays in Book Details ✅ Reviews I post → visible in My Reviews ✅ Profile picture persists even after logout/login ✅ Image URLs load correctly from /uploads/... ✅ Auth token persists and used across requests 💡 Additional Notes Backend port → 3001 Frontend port → 5173 MongoDB connection working Image uploads stored in: /backend/uploads/books /backend/uploads/users Use multer for file upload middleware ⚙️ Output Format Provide code blocks labeled like: // backend/controllers/bookController.js // (full updated code here) and so on for all affected files. 💬 End of prompt.
