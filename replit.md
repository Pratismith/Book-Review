# Book Review Application - Replit Setup

## Overview
A full-stack book review application built with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend. Users can browse books, add reviews with ratings, and manage their book collection with image uploads.

## Current Status
- **Last Updated**: October 4, 2025
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on port 5000 (React + Vite)
- **Backend**: ✅ Running on port 3001 (Node.js + Express)
- **Database**: ⚠️ MongoDB Atlas (requires setup - see instructions below)
- **Image Uploads**: ✅ Fully functional with Multer

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: MongoDB Atlas Setup Required

This application requires MongoDB Atlas. Please follow these steps:

1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - Sign up for a free account

2. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Create a new M0 (free tier) cluster
   - Choose a cloud provider and region

3. **Whitelist Replit's IP**:
   - Go to "Network Access" in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from anywhere (or add Replit's specific IP range)

4. **Get Your Connection String**:
   - Go to "Database" → "Connect" → "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string (it looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/`)
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual database password
   - Add your database name (e.g., `bookReview`) at the end

5. **Update backend/.env**:
   ```env
   PORT=3001
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_CLUSTER.mongodb.net/bookReview
   JWT_SECRET=kMhw6FuQFvOdvcPoQxSuhdK/lGyU+OYYjb8VIvgfm/k=
   ```

6. **Restart the App**: The workflow will automatically restart and connect to your MongoDB database.

### Production Behavior
In production mode:
- Backend serves on `0.0.0.0:5000`

## Deploying to Render

For detailed instructions on deploying this app to Render, see **[RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

### Quick Start for Render:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create a new Web Service on Render
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set build command: `npm run build`
5. Set start command: `npm start`
6. Add environment variables: `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV=production`
7. Deploy!

The app will automatically build the frontend and serve it from the backend.

## Known Issues
1. **MongoDB Connection**: Requires MongoDB Atlas setup (see instructions above)
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Must whitelist `0.0.0.0/0` or Replit's IP in MongoDB Atlas Network Access
3. **Image Persistence on Render**: Free tier doesn't persist uploaded files after restart. Consider using cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for production.

## Tips for Competition Submission
- The app features a beautiful, modern design with smooth animations
- All image uploads work correctly with proper preview functionality
- Profile page shows user's books and reviews in organized sections
- Book covers enhance the visual appeal of the application
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Search, filter, and sort functionality is fully operational
